### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd colabe-test-labo


2. Install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set up environment variables:
bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration


Required environment variables:
env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/colabe_db
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
CSRF_SECRET_KEY=another-secret-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=your-s3-endpoint
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
S3_BUCKET_NAME=colabe-artifacts


4. Initialize the database:
bash
reflex db migrate
python app/scripts/seed.py


### Development Server

Start the development server:
bash
reflex run


The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Deployment

1. Build the application:
bash
reflex export --frontend-only


2. Start background workers:
bash
rq worker --url redis://localhost:6379/0


3. Run the production server:
bash
reflex run --env prod


## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Register**: Create a new account at `/register`
   - This creates both a user account and a new tenant organization
   - You'll be assigned the "Owner" role automatically

2. **Dashboard**: After login, access the main dashboard at `/`
   - View your coin balance and subscription status
   - Navigate to different sections using the sidebar

3. **Security Scanning**: Visit `/security`
   - Click "Scan Now" to run Bandit and dependency scans
   - View findings with severity classifications
   - Trigger automated fixes for eligible vulnerabilities

4. **Policy Configuration**: Go to `/policies`
   - Set blocking severity levels
   - Configure minimum coverage requirements
   - Enable/disable auto-merge functionality
   - Adjust SLA timeframes

### API Usage

The platform provides a REST API documented at `/api-docs`. Key endpoints include:

- `GET /api/v1/projects` - List projects
- `POST /api/v1/projects/{id}/runs` - Trigger test runs
- `GET /api/v1/runs/{id}/artifacts` - Download artifacts

Authentication is via API keys provided in the `X-API-Key` header.

### Webhook Integration

Configure webhooks to receive notifications for:
- Run completions
- Security finding updates
- Pull request status changes

## Development

### Code Structure

- **State Management**: Each page has its own Reflex state class in `app/ui/states/`
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable components follow the atomic design pattern
- **Styling**: Uses TailwindCSS with a custom cyber-lux theme
- **Background Tasks**: Long-running operations use RQ workers

### Adding New Features

1. **Create Models**: Add new SQLModel classes in `app/core/models.py`
2. **Create State**: Add state management in `app/ui/states/`
3. **Create UI**: Build components in `app/ui/pages/`
4. **Add Routes**: Register pages in `app/app.py`

### Testing

Run the test suite:
bash
pytest


For security scanning:
bash
bandit -r app/


For code quality:
bash
ruff check app/
black --check app/
mypy app/


## API Reference

### Authentication
All API endpoints require authentication via the `X-API-Key` header.

### Rate Limits
- 1000 requests per hour for authenticated users
- 100 requests per hour for unauthenticated requests

### Webhooks
Configure webhook URLs in your project settings. Webhook payloads include:

**Run Completion**:
on
{
  "event_type": "run.completed",
  "run_id": 123,
  "status": "success",
  "completed_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}


## Configuration

### Database Configuration
The application uses PostgreSQL with automatic migrations. Connection settings are configured via the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

### Redis Configuration
Background job processing requires Redis. Configure via the `REDIS_URL` environment variable.

### S3 Storage
Artifacts are stored in S3-compatible storage. Required environment variables:
- `S3_ENDPOINT_URL`
- `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `S3_BUCKET_NAME`

### AI Integration
Security patch generation uses Anthropic's Claude API. Set your API key in the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Monitoring & Health Checks

### Health Endpoint
Check system health at `/health`:
- Database connectivity
- Redis connectivity  
- Background worker status

### Audit Logging
All user actions are logged in the audit trail available at `/audits`. This includes:
- User authentication events
- Policy changes
- Security scan triggers
- Autofix operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Errors**:
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check `DATABASE_URL` format
- Ensure database exists and user has permissions

**Redis Connection Issues**:
- Verify Redis server is running
- Check `REDIS_URL` configuration
- Ensure Redis is accessible from application

**Background Jobs Not Processing**:
- Start RQ worker: `rq worker --url redis://localhost:6379/0`
- Check Redis connectivity
- Review worker logs for errors

**Security Scanning Failures**:
- Ensure Bandit is installed: `pip install bandit`
- Check file permissions for repository access
- Verify CycloneDX tools are available

### Logging

Application logs are configured via Python's logging module. Set the log level with:

import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)


For debugging, use `DEBUG` level to see detailed request/response information.
